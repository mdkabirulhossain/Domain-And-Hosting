Q1. What are domains and examples?
A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP address, used to access a website from client software. In plain English, a domain name is the text that a user types into a browser window to reach a particular website. For instance, the domain name for Google is 'google.com'.

Key Components of a Domain
Domain Name:

This is the part that users type into their browser (e.g., example.com).
It consists of a unique name and an extension (also known as a TLD).
Top-Level Domain (TLD):

The part at the end of the domain, such as .com, .org, .net, or country-specific ones like .uk or .jp.
TLDs categorize domains. Some are general-purpose (like .com for commercial sites), while others have specific purposes or restrictions (like .gov for government websites).
Second-Level Domain (SLD):

This is the unique name chosen by the site owner, which comes before the TLD. For example, in example.com, example is the SLD.
It identifies the entity or business owning the domain.
Subdomains:

Subdomains allow for structuring sections of a website under the main domain. They appear before the second-level domain, like blog.example.com or support.example.com.
They’re useful for creating different sections or services under one main domain.
How Domains Work
When you enter a domain name in a browser:

Domain Name System (DNS): The DNS translates the human-readable domain name into an IP address that corresponds to the website's server.
Server Communication: Once the IP address is identified, the browser connects to the web server where the website is hosted.
Website Loading: The server sends back the website’s files, and the browser displays the content.
