Q1. Definition of web Hosting?
= Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet.

Q2. Types of Hosting
Shared Hosting: Multiple websites share the same server resources. It’s affordable and suitable for beginners or small websites but may experience slower speeds during high traffic.
VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting: A server is divided into multiple virtual servers, offering better control and performance than shared hosting.
Dedicated Hosting: You get an entire physical server dedicated to your website, ideal for large sites needing high performance and full control, though it’s more expensive.
Cloud Hosting: Uses multiple servers to balance load and maximize uptime. It's scalable and good for websites with varying traffic levels.
Managed Hosting: A provider manages the server, security, updates, and backups for you. Popular for applications like WordPress.
Serverless Hosting: Offers on-demand resources without server management, with pricing based on usage (e.g., AWS Lambda).
